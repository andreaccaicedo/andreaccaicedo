Hey, everyone. I'm a Systems Engineering student at Mariana University (a Social Communicator and avid self-learner on the side). 
At the moment I'm most interested in honing my skills as a programmer. Still got a long way to go, but you always learn something new!
I've meddled with some programming languages and tools like PHP and Laravel, Python, Java, Javascript and Angular. Wordpress is always a nice backup plan to have. I'm also interested in the world of Data Science and Analytics, so SQL and a solid Excel foundation, with complements like Power Query and Power BI have been a nice addition. I'd like to learn more about the usage of the aferementioned Python for Machine Learning and Data Processing.
