Hey, everyone. I'm a Systems Engineering student (a Social Communicator and avid self-learner too!). As to why, I'm keen on maintaining a balanced overview, between the Humanities and Sciences, as well as other sources of knowledge; a right amount of flexibility and structure could lead to significant insights about our world and some ways to face its problems ðŸŒ±âœ¨. \
\
At the moment I'm most interested in honing my skills as a programmerðŸ’». Still got a long way to go, but you always learn something new!\
\
<b>About those skills...</b>\
\
I've meddled with some programming languages and tools like PHP and Laravel, Python, Java, Javascript and Angular. Wordpress is always a nice backup plan to have. \
\
I'm also interested in the world of Data Science and Analytics, so SQL and a solid Excel foundation, with complements like Power Query and Power BI have been a nice addition. I'd like to learn more about the usage of the aforementioned Python for Machine Learning and Data Processing. \
\
<b>Some other ones.</b>\
\
About those soft skills, I'm a team player, ready to help and ask for help. I look for ways to apply the analytical and critical thinking to problem-solving, ready to learn what's needed for that as well.\
\
My experience at University has specially honed my skills with academic writing and project planning, as well as research and showing results.
